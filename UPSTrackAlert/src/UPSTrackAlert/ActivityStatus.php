 * UPS Track Alert API
 *
 * # Product Info  The UPS Track Alert API provides best in-class package tracking visibility with near real time event updates for an improved customer experience and stream line logistic management. Updates are pushed to the user as soon as available with no constant polling required, thereby improving operational efficiency. For more information on the UPS Track Alert API, please visit the <a href=\"https://developer.ups.com/api/reference/trackalertenhanced/product-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Product Info</a> page. <br/><p>Try out UPS APIs with example requests using Postman. Explore API documentation and sample applications through GitHub.</p>  <a href=\"https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/29542085-7513df2c-af1b-4e5c-8b5d-5797d03a6a44?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D29542085-7513df2c-af1b-4e5c-8b5d-5797d03a6a44%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D7e7595f0-4829-4f9a-aee1-75c126b9d417\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">   <img src=\"https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg\" alt=\"Run In Postman\" style=\"width: 128px; height: 32px;\"></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/UPS-API\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">   <img src=\"https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/webcontent/images/gitHubButton.svg\" alt=\"Open in GitHub\" style=\"width: 128px; height: 32px;\"> </a>  # Business Values  - **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Near real-time tracking information increases transparency, leading to higher customer satisfaction and trust. - **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates the necessity for continuous polling, thus saving resources and improving system responsiveness. - **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Access to near real-time data can help businesses optimize their supply chain and make informed logistics decisions. - **Optimizing Cash Flow Through Near Real-Time Delivery Tracking**: Improve cash flow by knowing that deliveries occurred in near real time. - **Mitigating Fraud and Theft through Near Real-Time Package Status Monitoring**: Reduce fraud and theft by knowing any time something happens to your packages.  # How does it work once I am setup as a user? You submit up to 100 UPS 1Z package tracking numbers to the API at a time, using OAUTH in a JSON format.  Your submission needs to include the URL where Track Alert will send a message with any events that occur to your 1Z package for the next 14 days.  This saves you the effort of polling UPS to determine what is the current status of your package.  # FAQs - **How do I check if a subscription to a 1Z was successful?** >  Within 8 seconds of submitting a 1Z package tracking number to Track Alert, you will receive a message confirming successful and un-successful 1Z's.    - **I stopped receiving event messages after 2 weeks and my package hasnâ€™t been delivered. Why?** >  Each 1Z subscription is valid for 14 days.  If the package has not been delivered within 14 days, you must resubscribe to the 1Z to continue receiving updates/events.  - **How do I get events that occurred prior to subscription?** >  Track Alert does not retain any history.  You should use the UPS Track API to receive history about your package.    - **How many 1Z tracking numbers can a subscriber subscribe to in one request?** >  You can subscribe to up to 100 1Z in each submission to the API.  A reply message will be sent via the API with details showing successful and unsuccessful 1Z's submissions.  - **What types of event data does Track Alert provide?** >  In addition to the expected local dates and times when the event occurred (including GMT date and time), you will receive details about the event that include status-type, status-code, status-description and status-description code.   Status types are:       M and MV = manifest information,        X = exception information (something out of the normal happened to your package, but it may still be delivered on time),        I = in-progress (on the way or moving normally through the UPS network),        U = update (there is an update to your package, normally the scheduled delivery has been updated, but it may still be delivered on time)       D = delivery information (loaded on delivery vehicle, out for delivery, delivered)   Status codes are a 2-character code that provide details about the event.  There is a list of these codes and their translations elsewhere on this portal.   Status descriptions are a very brief (a few words) describing the status code.   Status-description code is a overly simplified description of the event.  This description is intended for those who do not understand transportation.  - **What does the message look like?** >  This is what a message looks like for an event that is sent to your URL.  Not every field will have a value for every message.  We have converted the JSON format message to text format for clarity.       Those fields are:      1Z package tracking number      scheduled delivery date (this field maybe updated, example '20240905')     actual delivery date (this field is blank until the delivery event occurs)     actual delivery time (this field is blank until the delivery event occurs)     activity location city     activity location state/province     activity location postal code (this field is blank until the delivery event occurs)     activity location country     activity status type     activity status code     activity status description     activity status description code     local activity date     local activity time     GMT activity date     GMT activity time     delivery start time (example '150000')     delivery end time (example '170000')     delivery time description (example 'estimated delivery window' or 'end of day')     delivery photo (this field is only available for enhanced users)  - **Can I test this process?** >  Yes, there are two test 1Z's that you can submit, and resubmit that will send several events spaced 1 second apart.  Those two test 1Z's are 1ZCIETST0111111114 and 1ZCIETST0422222228.  Please ensure to use UPS Production CIE(https://wwwcie.ups.com/api/track/{version}). You can submit these 1Z's as often as you like. (no stress testing please.)    # Error Codes  | Error Code | HTTP Status | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | |------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | VSS000     | 400         | Invalid request and The Subscription request has been rejected.                                                                                                                                          | | VSS002     | 400         | Missing transId.                                                                                                                                                                                         | | VSS003     | 400         | Please enter a valid Transaction ID, The Subscription request has been rejected.                                                                                                                         | | VSS004     | 400         | Missing transactionSrc.                                                                                                                                                                                  | | VSS006     | 400         | Please enter a valid Transaction SRC, The Subscription request has been rejected.                                                                                                                        | | VSS100     | 500         | We're sorry, the system is temporarily unavailable.
