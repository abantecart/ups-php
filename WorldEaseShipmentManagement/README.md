# WorldEaseShipmentManagement
## Purpose The WorldEase Shipment Management API facilitates the consolidation of packages into a single shipment to reduce the brokerage fees and streamline international shipping processes. It offers users the ability to manage the shipment lifecycle including aggregating individual packages, closing out shipments once consolidation is completed and managing master and child shipments with options to delete as necessary.
